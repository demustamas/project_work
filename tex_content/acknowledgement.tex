\section*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to express my deepest gratitue to my advisor Dr. András Lukács,
who supported me with his guidance and valuable insights throughout my project work.

I am also grateful to Mr. Ákos Marosi granting the possibility to have a
look into the world of railway track inspection and providing access to the video
footages used as dataset.
His glowing eyes always represent the deepest passion some can feel towards the railway.
I am thankful to Ms. Ágnes Kemény for allowing the joint work taken with the colleagues
from MÁV Central Rail And Track Inspection Ltd.

I am also thankful for my partner, friends and coworkers who endured me on this journey while
I was balancing on the borders of insanity and obsessesion.

I do hope that the path taken is not the end, but only a beginning.
