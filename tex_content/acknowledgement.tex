I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Dr. András Lukács,
who supported me with his guidance and valuable insights throughout my project work.
Also, I would like say thank you to the colleagues of AI Research Group of Eötvös Lóránd University
who provided the possibility to attend on this special one-year training and gave their best
to enlighten us as students to the world of data analytics and data science, Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence.

I am also grateful to Mr. Ákos Marosi granting the possibility to have a
look into the world of railway track inspection and providing access to the video
footage used as dataset.
His glowing eyes always represent the deepest passion some can feel towards the railway.
I am thankful to Ms. Ágnes Kemény for allowing the joint work taken with the colleagues
from MÁV Central Rail And Track Inspection Ltd.

I am also thankful for my partner, friends and coworkers who endured me on this journey while
I was balancing on the borders of insanity and obsession.

Furthermore, I do hope that the path taken is not the end, but only a beginning.
