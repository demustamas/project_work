  abstract   = {The condition monitoring of railway track line is one of the fundamental tasks to ensure the safety of the railway transportation system. Railway track line is mainly made up of tracks, fasteners, bolts, backing plates, and so on. Given the requirements for rapid and accurate inspection, an innovative and intelligent method for multi-component identification and common defect detection of railway track line is investigated based on instance segmentation. More specifically, a railway track line image (RTL-I) dataset is constructed and annotated manually in this paper. After that, based on the work of YOLACT and YOLACT++, combined with prior knowledge, a railway track line image segmentation model (RTLSeg for short) is proposed. Firstly, taking the characteristics of the objects in the RTL-I dataset, preset anchors are redesigned and a feature enhanced module is introduced in the prediction head to improve the detection and segmentation accuracy of the model. Secondly, to strengthen the internal information propagation within the model, PaFPN (path aggregation feature pyramid network) is applied instead of FPN in RTLSeg. Thirdly, with the help of CoordConv, Coord-Protonet is presented to add position awareness explicitly to the model for more robust and higher quality prototype masks. Finally, to further improve the model performance, the attention mechanism is explored and a novel spatial attention-guided bounding box branch is employed in the enhanced prediction head. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible in detecting and segmenting multi-component and common defects of railway track line, and outperforms the compared baseline models. In particular, RTLSeg is able to achieve 91.35 bbox mAP and 91.60 mask mAP with the customized dataset. Meanwhile, the average inference speed reaches 13.07 fps. The average detection accuracy and recall are 100\% and 99.83\%, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of each optimized part of the proposed RTLSeg model is demonstrated by additional ablation study.},

  abstract  = {Reliable and economical inspection of rail tracks is paramount to ensure the safe and timely operation of the railway network. Automated vision based track inspection utilizing computer vision and pattern recognition techniques have been regarded recently as the most attractive technique for track surface defect detection due to its low-cost, high-speed, and appealing performance. However, the different modes of failures along with the immense range of image variations that can potentially trigger false alarms makes the vision based track inspection a very challenging task. In this paper, a multiphase deep learning based technique which initially performs segmentation, followed by cropping of the segmented image on the region of interest which is then fed to a binary image classifier to identify the true and false alarms is proposed. It is shown that the proposed approach results in improved detection performance by mitigating the false alarm rate.},

While land-cover or urban mapping have been extensively studied, industrial cartography remains a field yet to explore, in spite of tremendous needs. We present and compare here four approaches for railway detection in very high resolution images. They use various kind of filtering approaches, including the trained filters of fully convolutional networks. Moreover, they benefit from different a-priori and post-processing techniques to make them more robust. We evaluate all approaches on a challenging dataset captured on an operating station site with complex objects.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30\% relative improvement to 67.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},
